# 42 - Printf

## About
Printf is the second project from the 42-cursus curriculum. It is an excerice to recreate the printf() function in C programming language.
All functions and .c files are compiled with the Makefile to create a libftprintf.a library. This library is used in later projects of the curriculum.

This repository is mostly just an archive of my studies, and can serve as a reference for future students in a time of need. However, I strongly encourage students to avoid just copy-pasting.
